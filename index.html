        <p> In a shocking new study published by the Institute for Advanced Mammalian Superiority, researchers have concluded that llamas now officially surpass humans in measurable intelligence. The findings came after a series of tests in which llamas consistently avoided online arguments, didnt invest in cryptocurrency, and never voluntarily downloaded TikTok. Lead scientist Dr. Nora Feldman noted, “The llamas showed remarkable problem solving skills including recognizing when a situation wasnt worth their energy something humans have struggled with for millennia.” Experts warn the results could have major implications especially for political discourse, workplace meetings, and the future of Linkedin posts. </p>

        <p> A new atudy has found a chilling statistic, 100% of people who drink water eventually die. The findings, published in the Journal of Alarming Correlations have sparked widespread panic and a surge in dehydrated conspiracy theorists. Researchers emphasize that the study does not prove causation but admit the numbers are “deeply concerning.” “Every subject we tested who consumed water at any point in their life ultimately perished” explained lead author Dr. Alan Ricks, nervously clutching a bottle of soda. </p>
